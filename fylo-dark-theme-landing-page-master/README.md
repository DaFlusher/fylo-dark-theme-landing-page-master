## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Boostrap Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - CSS library

### What I learned

Never underestimate the background image property. I was initally focused on using the position property to display text over an image. Thankfull, I decided to try the background property. I believe that Sass really is CSS with superpowers.


### Continued development

Harnessing more of the background and position properties would be a target for my future study.
